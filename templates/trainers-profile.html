<img width="200" height="267" id="emi" src="/i/emi.jpg" alt="Emi" title="Kudos founder and trainer, Emi."/>
<p>Ms Emiliza Ahmad, Founder and Lead Trainer at Kudos, is a dedicated and devoted English language trainer, specializing in public speaking, presentation and general English improvement training.</p>
<p>She graduated from Exeter University, United Kingdom with a degree in B. Ed. TESL (Teaching English as a Second Language). From 2001 to 2006 she built a solid base of experience teaching secondary students in various forms; starting out with Malaysian public schools and ending up with the renowned private school Sri Cempaka, Cheras, Selangor. Cempaka gave her experience in designing syllabuses catered to the needs of students who were already proficient in English.</p>
<p>In 2008 she moved into self-employment, giving home tuition to a wide range of students and provided training to various companies. One such company was Lim Kok Wing University, Cyberjaya where she brought the English level of Immersion Class students up to was is required to enter degree courses at the university. This was a challenging role as most of her students were foreign and had extremely low levels of English; she had to ensure each and every student got the maximum benefit possible from each lesson. This broadened her teaching experience as she had now handled not only students who were weak in English but also those who were not familiar with the language at all.</p>
<p>Expanding her skills and experience she then took the opportunity to provide training for the Selangor Human Resource Development Centre (SHRDC), Shah Alam in 2009. Such work has seen her teach to companies such as Balda Solutions, Ipoh and Philips Lumileds, Penang, teaching to a range of employees from factory workers to administration and technical staff. She also taught students on Industrial Skill Enhancement Programmes (INSEP) and Workforce Technical Transformation Programmes (WTTP), preparing them for the working environment where a solid grasp of the English language is essential in any company or organisation in Malaysia.</p>
<p>In 2010 she completed training at Box Hill Institute in Melbourne, Australia which qualified her to teach English for Advanced Diploma. She is also a member of the Malaysian <a href="http://www.melta.org.my/">English Language Teaching Association (MELTA)</a> and attends their regular seminars and workshops which keep members up-to-date with latest teaching techniques and methodologies.</p>
